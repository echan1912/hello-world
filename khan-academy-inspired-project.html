  <h2>Why Imperial College is a great place to study biochemistry</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Offers many different pathways for degrees, including Year in Industry/Research, Research Abroad and Management</li>
    <li>You can choose to specialise in either Biochemistry or Biotechnology</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Top 3 most famous biochemists</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Louis Pasteur</li>
    <li>Alexander Fleming</li>
    <li>Fredrick Sanger</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Basic info</h2>
  <p>Biochemistry, as the name suggests is the field of chemistry in biology, aka <strong>the molecules of life.</strong>
  Usually this encompasses the study of <em>proteins</em> and <em>nucleic acids</em>, such as DNA. Researchers may refer to this as molecular biology.
The more biology-focussed parts of biochemistry, namely cell(ular) biology is also important, as the understand of human organelles and bacteria are useful for the study of molecules involved in processes such as
metabolism, replication, protein synthesis, cell-cell interactions and navigating surroundings.<strong>Biochemistry is closely related to biotech</strong> that involves <strong><em>innovating treatments for disease</em></strong>,
ways to enhance research by utilising different biological materials and drug development. Newer hot topics include bioinformatics, computational biology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering.</p>
  <h2>Songs</h2>
  <p>methionine and tryptophan<br>
and phenylalanine.<br>
isoleucine, glycine then<br>
there's valine, alanine...<br>
...these are all nonpolar, man<br>
and proline is as well.<br>
there's another that i'll add,<br>
it's leucine, ain't it swell?<br>
glutamine and threonine<br>
and cysteine, tyrosine...<br>
these are polar, serine too<br>
as well asparagine.<br>
now we'll see which ones are charged<br>
electrically for you.<br>
glutamic acid is a one
aspartic acid two.<br>
arginine and histidine<br>
are basic; am i wrong?<br>
as is lysine now we're done<br>
the amino acid song.<br>
